# cipher-challenges

Originally written as 4 coding challenges.

The answer changes with every re-run of the code in crypto.py.

1. Caesar Cipher. See 1_challenge.txt and 1_guess.txt.
2. Image steganography - hidden in base64 string. See 2_challenge.txt, 2_guess.txt, and 2_img.jpg.
3. Image steganography - hidden in RGB pixels. See 3_challenge.txt, 3_guess.txt, and 3_img.jpg.
4. Deobfuscating a hash function to increase efficiency by 100,000x to then brute force the password by creating a hash collision. See 4_challenge.txt and 4_guess.txt.
